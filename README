Experiments were performed on the system with Intel Core i5 CPU @ 2.3GHz and 8GB of RAM.
- number of trials 10^5
- optimization flag -o2
- noise&outlier-free synthetic scene
- error is computed as 0.5*log10(||P2gt - P2||^2 + ||P3gt - P3||^2)
- MAXIT is the maximum number of iterations for the golden section method
- MAXLM is the maximum number of local minima of the cost function

1) Setup #1 (MAXLM = 5, MAXIT = 10)

	Average runtime: 0.11 ms
	Median error: -2.88
	Mean error: -2.42
	Fails (error > -1): 23.0%

2) Setup #2 (MAXLM = 10, MAXIT = 20)

	Average runtime: 0.31 ms
	Median error: -5.41
	Mean error: -4.79
	Fails (error > -1): 11.5%

3) Setup #3 (MAXLM = 20, MAXIT = 40)

	Average runtime: 0.75 ms
	Median error: -9.14
	Mean error: -8.33
	Fails (error > -1): 5.4%

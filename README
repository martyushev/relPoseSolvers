Experiments were performed on the system with Intel Core i5 CPU @ 2.3GHz and 8GB of RAM.

Notes:
- number of trials 10^5
- optimization flag -o2
- noise&outlier-free images of synthetic scene
- error is computed as 0.5*log10(||P2 - P2gt||^2 + ||P3 - P3gt||^2)
- MAXIT is the maximum number of iterations for the golden section method
- MAXLM is the maximum number of local minima of the cost function
- cost function evaluation and local minima polishing are parallelized

1) Setup #1 (MAXLM = 5, MAXIT = 10)

	Average runtime: 0.12 ms
	Median error: -2.88
	Mean error: -2.42
	Fails (error > -1): 23.0%

2) Setup #2 (MAXLM = 10, MAXIT = 20)

	Average runtime: 0.29 ms
	Median error: -5.42
	Mean error: -4.79
	Fails (error > -1): 11.5%

3) Setup #3 (MAXLM = 20, MAXIT = 40)

	Average runtime: 0.63 ms
	Median error: -9.14
	Mean error: -8.33
	Fails (error > -1): 5.4%

4) Setup #4 (MAXLM = 50, MAXIT = 30)

	Average runtime: 0.69 ms
	Median error: -8.11
	Mean error: -7.79
	Fails (error > -1): 1.9%
